//Hasmaps are also known as unordered maps. 
//They are used to store key value pairs.
//They are implemented using hash tables.
//They are unordered, so they do not store the elements in any particular order.
//They are associative containers, which means that they store elements as key value pairs.

//The syntax to create a hashmap is:
//unordered_map<key_type, value_type> name;

//The key_type is the type of the key and the value_type is the type of the value.

//The syntax to insert an element in the hashmap is:
//name.insert({key, value});

//The syntax to access an element in the hashmap is:
//name[key];

//The syntax to delete an element in the hashmap is:
//name.erase(key);

//The syntax to check if an element is present in the hashmap is:
//name.find(key) != name.end();

//The syntax to get the size of the hashmap is:
//name.size();

//The syntax to check if the hashmap is empty is:
//name.empty();

//The syntax to clear the hashmap is:
//name.clear();
